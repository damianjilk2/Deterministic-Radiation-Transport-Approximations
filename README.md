# Deterministic-Radiation-Transport-Approximations

This project is a Python implementation for approximating deterministic radiation transport in a 1-D geometry. It includes calculations for distance, macroscopic cross-section, optical distance, and interaction probability along a ray.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to approximate the adjoint solution in 3D space as fast as possible. It currently includes functions for calculating distances, macroscopic cross-sections, optical distances, and interaction probabilities. The code is intended for educational and research purposes and is under active development.
